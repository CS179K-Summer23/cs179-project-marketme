Test Case Group: Age-Restricted Sales Compliance Mechanism

Product Classification
1.1. Add an alcohol product to the inventory and mark it as age-restricted.
1.2. Add a non-alcohol product to the inventory and ensure it is not marked as age-restricted.

Age Verification Pop-Up
2.1. Add an age-restricted product (e.g., alcohol) to the cart and proceed to checkout. Verify that an age verification pop-up appears.
2.2. Add a non-age-restricted product to the cart and proceed to checkout. Verify that no age verification pop-up appears.

Date of Birth Entry
3.1. Enter a valid date (Or scan an ID) of birth that confirms the customer is OVER the legal age limit and proceed. Verify that the transaction continues.
3.2. Enter a non-valid date (Or scan an ID) of birth that confirms the customer is BELOW the legal age limit and proceed. Verify that the transaction is halted and the age-restricted item is removed from the cart.

Edge Cases
4.1. Enter a date of birth for a customer who just turned the legal age this month. Verify that the system allows the transaction.
4.2. Enter a date of birth for a customer who will turn the legal age next month. Verify that the system does not allow the transaction and removes the age-restricted item from the cart.

Cart Behavior
5.1. Add multiple age-restricted and non-age-restricted items to the cart. Enter a non-valid date of birth and proceed. Verify that only age-restricted items are removed from the cart.
5.2. Add multiple age-restricted items to the cart. Enter a valid date of birth and proceed. Verify that all age-restricted items remain in the cart and the transaction continues.

Error Messages and User Feedback
6.1. Attempt a transaction with an age-restricted item but provide an invalid date of birth. Verify the clarity and accuracy of the error message displayed.
6.2. Attempt a transaction with multiple age-restricted items but provide an invalid date of birth. Verify that a clear message is displayed indicating which items have been removed from the cart.


The age requirement is set at 21 years, as this software is primarily designed for use in the United States where the legal age for purchasing age-restricted items like alcohol is 21.
