## Major features (Software Specifications) ⚙️

MarketMe's IMS is a terminal software offering several essential features:

1. **eCommerce API Integration 🌐**: Seamlessly pull in product information for testing program features.
2. **Product Management 🛠️**: Manual input, deletion, and update of product details.
3. **Barcode Integration 📸**: Utilize a barcode scanner for existing products and input new ones using fake barcodes/QR codes.
4. **Alert System 🔔**: ESP API-driven alerts for sales/price changes, low stock, and impending expiration dates.
5. **Newsletter 🗞️**: Regular updates for subscribers and clearance product recommendations.
6. **Checkout System 💰**: Calculate taxes based on zip code, allow coupon codes, and update internal databases.
7. **Sales Report 📊**: Daily sales reports for managerial review.
8. **Inventory Filtering 🔍**: Sort inventory based on popularity, alphabetical order, etc.
9. **Sale Restrictions ⛔**: Prohibit sales on certain items based on location, customer age, etc.


## Additional Information 📌

Please note, the customer account system is beyond the scope of this software. Our focus lies in providing immaculate inventory and sales management. However, during the checkout process, the system sends pertinent transaction data to a separate system (assumed to handle customer accounts) in an encrypted manner to maintain user privacy.

We prioritize flexibility in our operations. In case of any feasibility issues with the barcode feature due to hardware constraints, we plan to replace it with a QR code feature, leveraging mobile devices as barcode readers.

Let's elevate your business operations with our state-of-the-art **Inventory Management System**! 💼
